* pull up from blas to tlas
  if mesh is 'big' and 'heavy' one, we better pull-up 1-2 levels of hierarchy.
  so, tlas will have 2-4 more leaves (not one instance, but 2-4) pointing to 1/2 level of hierarchy in blas.
* combine both shadow_strength & combined shadows in one bitmask
  it is more accurate, as it takes full res normal into account, not half res
  probably not very expensive also
+ offset from areas inside static cascade towards sun
+ checkerboard layout of rt shadows
+ frustum with sun size
+ use 1-bit result (instead of texture), when typed uav is not available
+ calculate planes in cpp code (optimization)
+ fix plane for horizontal sun
+ checkerboard optimization (reduce memory)
+ getAdditionalShadows _before_ contact shadows
* checkerboard optimization (we can store 1 bit of visibility, writing whole tile)
* offset from areas inside csm towards sun (for planes, etc!)
